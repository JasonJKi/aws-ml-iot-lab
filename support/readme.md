# Support

This file contains instructions for Lab Setup of all devices and cleanup after the first time devices have been used. Also there are a few useful scripts here as well. 

## Configuring the Device ( first time )

When these kits arive they are missing:
* Wifi Software
* WPA Security Software

The following instructions and scripts [here](https://github.com/chrisking/upsquaredsetup) cover everything that is needed to patch the kits via automation or with specific commands.


## After Lab Cleanup

Before packing the UpSquared devices into their boxes for the next lab, the systems must be restored to a clean state. This process has been automated via a script provided below but the rough directions are below if they need to be performed manually

```

```


## Full Restore ( Worst Case )

The absolute worst case scenario is a bricked device or the passwords have been changed. If that occurs find a local Linux Desktop( a Deep Lens would work in a pinch) or a local Linux VM with a Desktop and a 16GB or greater USB drive.

Follow the instructions [here](https://downloads.up-community.org/download/up-squared-iot-grove-development-kit-ubuntu-16-04-server-image/) to restore the UpSquared kit to its original factory settings.
